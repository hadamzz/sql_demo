# sql_demo

In this demonstration of my skill set, my primary task is to do a research project about people whom a fictional company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The data set I've used only contains six CSV files.

I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
